I am Assistant Professor of Clinical Nutrition at the Department of Nutritional
Science and Dietetics of the University of Peloponnese in Kalamata-Greece.
My expertise is in investigating the effects of diet, mainly Mediterranean diet
including its foods and food components, on health-related outcomes with
emphasis on the clinical-laboratory profile, inflammation, oxidative stress,
metabolic indices, and biomarkers related to chronic disease.
